RISC-V Simulator Suite (RV32I)

A complete RISC-V RV32I simulator written in modern C++, implementing:

Memory module

Register file

Instruction decoder & disassembler

Single-hart CPU emulator

Instruction-accurate RV32I execution engine

Tracing, debugging output, and program loaders

This project replicates the core behavior of a real RISC-V processor, executing binary programs one instruction at a time while maintaining correct architectural state.

🔧 Features
✔ RV32I Instruction Set Support

Implements all base RV32I instructions, including:

Arithmetic & logical operations

Load/store

Branch & jump

Immediate + register variants

System instructions (ECALL, EBREAK)

✔ CPU Execution Engine

Program counter management

ALU operations

Memory access

Illegal-instruction handling

Optional trace mode showing each executed instruction

✔ Memory System

Byte / halfword / word reads and writes

Safe address access

Memory dumping utilities

✔ Disassembler

Converts machine code into human-readable RV32I assembly

Matches official RISC-V encoding formats

✔ Register File

32 registers (x0–x31)

x0 hardwired to zero

Register state dump utilities

🚀 Building the Simulator

Compile using g++:

g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o rv32i main.cpp cpu_single_hart.cpp rv32i_decode.cpp rv32i_hart.cpp memory.cpp registerfile.cpp hex.cpp

Or using your Makefile:

make

▶ Running the Simulator

Run a hex program:
./rv32i prog.hex

Enable tracing:
./rv32i -t prog.hex

Dump registers at the end:
./rv32i -l prog.hex

🧪 Example Test Files

Common test programs include:

add.hex

branch.hex

memtest.hex

Example usage:
./rv32i -t add.hex

🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates:

CPU architecture fundamentals

Instruction decoding

State transitions in a CPU pipeline

Memory/register interactions

Binary program execution

Systems programming in C++

It serves as a foundation for understanding how real processors interpret and execute machine code.
